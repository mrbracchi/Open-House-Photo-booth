# Open-House-Photo-booth
Adapted from the All Seeing Pi Project to meet the needs of schools and other various organizations

Code is all commented to show what each step accomplishes. Some of the comments explain what the original code does and some are direct quotes from the All Seeing Pi tutorial which can be found at this url: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/the-all-seeing-pi

What this program does:
 [] Provides the user with ready to go code to put together a photo booth using overlays provided by the Raspbery Pi Foundation
 [] Allows an organization to stamp each photo with a water mark or slogan in addition to the overlays
 [] Preserve the original photo without the water mark

Still to come:
 [] Twitter integration to automatically apply Hashtags and Mentions
 [] New overlays
 [] Resolution adjustments for Higher resolutions (including revisions to old overlays maybe)
 [] Bash Script to setup the folder structure for the user and automatically copy over resources
